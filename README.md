# Traffic-predict-NL
A university project I had. Basically I had to come up with a "Big data" or "AI" project and thus I created an app, where a NN is fed historic (filtered data for the particular high in interest) data (downloaded manually from the dutch gov website - it's manually downloaded as there is a CAPTCHA protection as well as a max amount per day of queries that you can make). After the algorithm is trained the live data (which is available) is streamed and stored for a fixed amount of time and based on it the algorithm outputs whether there would be a traffic jam.
